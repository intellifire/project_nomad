## Key Decisions

1. **Clean Architecture** - All code follows Uncle Bob's layered architecture with strict dependency rules
2. **SOLID Principles** - Non-negotiable requirement for all components
3. **Dual Deployment** - SAN (standalone) and ACN (agency-integrated) modes
4. **Engine Abstraction** - WISE and FireSTARR via common interface (from WiseGuy patterns)
